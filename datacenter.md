# Datacenter

## E.Datacenter.2.b

Data center IND1, which was operated by LightBound formerly, was acquired by DataBank in December 2018. It located in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. The Data center facility has uninterrupted 4MW power provided by A/B diesel power generators with N+1 design. It has 20 network providers and 2 microfiber rings to connect to IND2. The facility is under 24*7*365 security service.

Tidal Energy

Tidal energy is the energy converted from the tidal force created by sun-moon and earth rotation. Tidal energy could be extracted from the moving masses of water by tidal stream generators.

A hyperscale data center is planned to launch in 2024 which will be powered by tidal energy from SIMEC Atlantis Energy in Scottish Highlands.

China

China is growing fast in installed renewable capacity. By 2018, China has a total capacity of 728 GW renewable power. In 2019, the installed hydropower, wind power, PV (Photovoltaics), and bio-mass power capacity are expected to grow 2.2%, 14.1, 14.9 and 23.6%, respectively.

China made up 34% of global investment for renewable energy, about $288.9 billion in 2018 which is about three times the United States' investment. With a large amount of investment, innovations and technology development are on a fast track, the renewable power market is expending quickly which greatly reduced the cost of renewable power technology.

Considering China's large demand for energy, coal is still the main source. By 2050, China expected to deduce coal consumption to 30%-50%. As the world's largest population, China is making a great effort in developing renewable energy which will help protect the environment and benefit for generations.

## E.Multipass.2:

Primary instance could be created by simple multipass shell command (multipass start). When users try to start or shell into an instance by multipass before its existance, multipass will create the primary instance. There could only have one primary instance. When created, the primary instance will be built based on the latest Ubuntu LTS image and will be configured by default settings.
