## Introduction

Amazon Comprehensive does the analysis of text materials by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and draws insights by identifying domain languages, entities, key phrases, sentiment, syntax, and topic modeling. On Amazon comprehend console, it can process up to 1000 words at a time, while batch text analysis can take in documents saved in AWS S3 buckets. Users can also choose to use AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or SDKs for different programming languages to interact with Amazon Comprehend server directly, get real-time analysis results or return results into AWS S3 buckets. Amazon Comprehensive can train customized classifiers, then use the trained model to analyze test data. Customized classifiers can best perform and give insights based on customer's specialty and interests [@227comprehendf]. @fig:227AWSComprehend shows the workflow of Amazon Comprehend [@227comprehendmech].

Amazon Comprehend medical is good at dealing with unstructured medical records. Amazon Comprehend Medical is specific for better extracting information from medical notes or reports. It can accurately draw information from complex and various types of medical terms, such as dosages, strengths, frequencies, and medications. Amazon Comprehend Medical can connect related medicines with dosages, strengths, and frequencies, which for example, will help reduce the time for an analyst to find the best patient candidates to perform clinical study [@227AWSComMed].

```  

Similarly, there are other commands for batch detecting key-phrases, dominant-language, sentiment, and syntax.

*Note: If you get HTTP code of 200, it means the text analysis is successfully processed.*


## Custom Classification

Amazon Comprehend offers users to train their unique text analysis NLP models with AWS sequence tagging deep neural network model [@227AWSComM]. When preparing custom classification, choose between multi-class and multi-label modes. Multi-class mode specifies a single class for every document; classes are exclusive. A custom classifier trained with multi-class mode could be used for real-time analysis and batch analysis. Multi-label mode specifies one or more classes for every document. A custom classifier trained with multi-label mode could only be used for batch analysis.
